 * Improved Nielsen's flagship TV ratings by creating model for TV viewing in Pyspark which trains 10x faster, admits 4x fewer false positives, and is more defensible to clients compared to previous production model (US patent pending)
 * Designed and built alpha version of company-internal Python framework for streamlining and automating data science workflows
 * Revamped documentation for internal framework by configuring Sphinx, deploying on AWS, and automating build process
 * Presented Spark tech talk to 350 data scientists, software engineers, and business leaders across Nielsen
 * Created several Python & Spark libraries to unify team's workflow, improve code readability, and enable consistent comparison of different candidate models

**Software Engineering Intern - Qualtrics** (June 2017 - August 2017)
 * Added new features (pagination, custom data types, UI enhancements) to "action planning" module on Employee Experience platform, better allowing managers to effect change in their team
 * Redesigned handling of page filters for action planning dashboards by refactoring shared and product-specific code
 * Increased test coverage for product by 10% and wrote test files from scratch for untested services

**Teaching Assistant - Northwestern University** (March 2016 - June 2018)
 * Mentored students in intro programming, intermediate Python, discrete mathematics, and data structures courses
 * Assisted with curriculum and exam design; led small-group tutorial sections; taught students individually

**Lead Helpdesk Analyst - Northwestern University**	(September 2014 - June 2018)
 * Developed Chrome extension to automate often-forgotten parts of help desk tickets, deploying to 60 student staff members and reducing incomplete tickets by over 90%
 * Fostered individual growth by mentoring, managing, training, and reviewing 5 student consultants semiannually
 * Wrote Python scripts to assist with scheduling, accounting for staffing needs, class schedules, and individual preferences
