I'm currently a senior data scientist at [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/solutions/nielsen-global-media/). I did my master's in computer science and undergrad in computer science and the [Integrated Science Program](httpqs://www.isp.northwestern.edu/), both at Northwestern (go 'cats!). My email address is me@(this domain).
