This is a page of things I'm hoping to read "soon" (for some value of soon). It's some cross between a digital bookshelf and public bookmarks, where I drop papers that cross my radar or blog posts, talks, or other ideas.

Some of these I've printed out and carry around with me. Others are unlikely to ever be read because they're so far out of my areas of expertise or interest. While this page is mostly for my own reference, it also pretty broadly shows the types of work I'm interested in.

## Post ideas
Brains are black boxes, too - something that Kidd said in the [2020 predictions](https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/02/top-minds-in-machine-learning-predict-where-ai-is-going-in-2020/) article

Who is responsible for (mis)use of tools? The OpenAI debate about GPT2, other advances in language models, deepfakes, etc ... Kidd talked about this in the article above too.
