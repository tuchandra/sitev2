This is a page of things I'm hoping to read soon. It includes papers and blog posts, along with talks and other forms of media. Things at the top of each section have been around for longer, and there's no real order to when I'll get around to each item (if ever). This page is mostly for my own reference.

## Post ideas

Brains are black boxes, too - something that Kidd said in the [2020 predictions](https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/02/top-minds-in-machine-learning-predict-where-ai-is-going-in-2020/) article

Who is responsible for (mis)use of tools? The OpenAI debate about GPT2, other advances in language models, deepfakes, etc ... Kidd talked about this in the article above too.
