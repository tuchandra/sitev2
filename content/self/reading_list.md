This is a page of things I'm hoping to read "soon" (for some value of soon). It's some cross between a digital bookshelf and public bookmarks, where I drop papers that cross my radar or blog posts, talks, or other ideas.

Some of these I've printed out and carry around with me. Others are unlikely to ever be read because they're so far out of my areas of expertise or interest. While this page is mostly for my own reference, it also pretty broadly shows the types of work I'm interested in.
