## Full papers
The [full list of papers](https://programs.sigchi.org/cscw/2020/index?isScrollLoadNeeded=true) is really difficult to get through. It's great to see CSCW being such a big conference, but that comes with two challenges.

The first is that it's difficult to see what kinds of papers I might be interested in. I have no real options besides going through the whole program and judging papers by their titles and (a few sentences of the) abstracts.

The second is that it's easy to miss interesting papers, because scrolling long lists is exhausting! There will certainly be papers on here that I would like to read, but that I simply skipped over while scrolling a list of 300 papers.

That's why I'll repeat---if you see anything that looks interesting, please email me about it!
