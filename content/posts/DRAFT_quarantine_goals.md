Today marks two weeks of fully remote work; my first day at home was Thursday, March 12th. This post reflects on my experience.

What are some of my goals for quarantine?
 * Clean up my [reading list]({{< ref "/reading_list" >}})
 * Read a lot (how many?) of papers
 * Use up as much food at home as possible
 * Throw out unnecessary things from my room ("tidy up" the space)
 * Free associate on my research interests
