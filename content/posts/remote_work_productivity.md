TODO summary!

<!--more-->

The motivation for this post is a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/justicedanielh/status/1238560925575024640) by Daniel Justice that I came across recently. I'll reproduce its text below:

> I've seen so many silver-lining comments from academics about how being quarantined will help them get progress on their backlog of projects. I've said it myself. But we need to recognize that this response is *deeply* pathological--we should not be normalizing this thinking.
>
> So many presumptions, too: 1) that you'll be healthy enough in quarantine to do that work; 2) that you won't be attending to others' health needs; 3) that you'll be able to focus on it in the midst of all this; and 4) that we can or should be "productive" in a time of pandemic.
>
> We know that dehumanizing capitalist productivity thinking has deeply penetrated academia, but this is next level. Maybe pandemic is the time to reassert our full humanity, not our capacity to be guilt-compelled machinery for institutions that already treat us as disposable.
>
> This thread isn’t to shame people—again, my thoughts went there too. But that it’s such an instantaneous place to go says something very sad about what motivates so much of our work, especially in times like these.
>
> And it’s been rightly pointed out that for faculty in more tenuous and insecure positions it’s a privilege to *not* go there, so it’s also vital for those of us with more secure jobs to work harder to improve conditions so colleagues don’t feel like this is their only option.
>
> Find comfort where you can. But if your reflex response is “how can I become more of a productivity machine?” I’m not sure how that contributes to long-term health or happiness. Maybe that deserves a bit of reflection, and maybe the discomfort with the question does, too.

I've heard this sentiment repeated in various forms, and I can only agree with it. I was (am?) certainly guilty of feeling this way, too. There are two things at play here, I think.


## Remote work, then vs. now
The first is the idea that remote work simply amounts to a change in location. This definitely isn't the case for me anymore---but when Nielsen first announced mandatory WFH a month or so ago, many of my coworkers and I didn't realize how different it would be. We knew there'd be some differences---a lack of casual office chat, no more lunches together---but not nearly the extent to which it'd be different.

Sidenote: even writing that makes me look back at how naive I was and how naive that sounds---just weeks ago! I guess that's what you call "growth."

Perhaps obviouslly, being at home 24/7 is far, far different from working from home every Friday. And that's to say nothing of the folks who have kids to take care of, sick family members, or any numeber of other things that make working from home more challenging.

I've also started to believe that Nielsen being so remote-friendly, while it made mandatory WFH easier mechanically (we already had collaboration tools set up, we knew how to access the VPN, etc.), made the mental shock of the differences more pronounced. Put otherwise, because it *wasn't* mechanically that different from working from home on a Friday, it made me feel that it shouldn't be that different mentally, either.


## Productivity and what motivates me
The second idea is about productivity and what motivates us. I had the same reflex as Justice describes, about how I can be more productive. I have an unpublished blog post about my goals for quarantine, which (loosely) were to read more and try to make my research interests more fully formed.

Those were my goals before quarantine, though; it's not like they've changed as a result of being at home. I've been trying to read more (and succeeding) for months, and my research interests are naturally developing as a result. Expecting to do that *more*, I realize, is unfair to myself.

Another valid question is whether one should even expect *baseline* productivity during a global pandemic. The world is in a once-in-a-century disaster right now, and the expectation that I can maintain my normal output---leave alone exceed it---is likely unrealistic, too. (And again, that's to say nothing of the folks who have kids.)

Looking back on the last few weeks, most of what used to be "social time" now consists of watching Twitch streams and playing Animal Crossing. Hell, I'm passively farming balloons as I write this.

What does that mean for me going forward? To stop worrying about productivity. To stop feeling like I *have* to be reading. I've read roughly a paper a week for the past six months, and I have every reason to be satisfied with that.

Sometimes I feel bad about playing video games all evening. But more and more, I'm trying to remind myself: no, you don't have to be productive; no, you shouldn't even *expect* to be productive. So maybe the 100 hours I've poured into Animal Crossing weren't so bad, after all.
