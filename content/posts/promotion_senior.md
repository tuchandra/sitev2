I was recently promoted to senior data scientist! This is a short post with some details and reflection.

<!--more-->

For two years at Nielsen, I was part of a rotational program in data science that put me on several different teams. I spent the last year on a research team studying the use of Bayesian inference for measurement. I'm going to be continuing that work in my new role.

This is why I was joking to my friends that my new job is "senior what-I-was-doing-before." It really feels that way! I know that's kind of how promotions work, though.

Most importantly, I'm excited to have more personal responsibility for my own career. The rotational program felt like "training wheels," but now I'm in the driver's seat. I'm looking forward to being able to *act* on my reflections about what's important to me, what kinds of problems I want to solve, and what opportunities are available to me.

For now, though, I'm on vacation for a couple weeks. I'll be using the time to catch up on both reading and my Animal Crossing island, and recharge after a draining several months.
