This post contains materials for my PyMCon talk, *Learning Bayesian Statistics with Pokemon GO*.

<!--more-->


## What was this talk?
[PyMCon](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymcon/) is a virtual conference for the Bayesian community. While organized by the PyMC3 developers, the conference exists for anyone interested in general-purpose Bayesian inference. Register for the (mostly async) conference on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pymcon-2020-tickets-121404065829)!

I used Pokemon GO to motivate questions that could be answered via Bayesian modeling.

> In Pokemon GO, players can rarely encounter "shiny" Pokemon, or hatch other desirable Pokemon from eggs.
> The exact probabilities with which these happen are unknown.
> But by using Bayesian inference and PyMC3, we can model these probabilities.
> 
> In this beginner-level tutorial, we will introduce fundamental principles of Bayesian modeling, then ask questions about Pokemon GO.
> We will develop PyMC3 models that can help us answer these questions.

In the talk, I motivated and live coded three Bayesian models. The first two were on shiny rates (what was the probability of seeing a shiny in X event?),and the last was on egg hatch rates (did the probability of hatching a certain Pokemon change midway through an event?).

## Code and data
The code and data are available on [Github](https://github.com/tuchandra/pymcon2020_talk).
The notebooks are cleaned up versions of the ones that I live coded in the recorded video.

## Slides
See [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bvSrNqPjMwqISJWPYz8bgPIxvk0oU-1H26sxtmaOir4/edit#slide=id.p).

## Other resources
See my post on [Bayesian inference resources]({{< ref "bayesian_resources.md" >}}).

## Video
Coming soon! (I still have to finish editing it, then it will be uploaded to YouTube, and hopefully made available after the conference.)
