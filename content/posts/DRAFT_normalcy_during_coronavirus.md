In which I reflect on my experience trying to maintain a sense of normalcy during the coronavirus outbreak.

<!--more-->

Today marks just under two weeks of fully remote work; my first day at home was Thursday, March 12. I recognize, first off, that I'm extremely lucky to be able to hole up and work from home during this pandemic. My sense of normalcy will be very different from that of a healthcare worker or grocery store employee, who likely have none. I am grateful for this. I *do* understand how privileged I am to even be able to write this, in the evening after being done with work.




## Things that work



Staying at my desk all day has been mentally and physically draining.

It's weird---it feels like we're in (what I imagine to be) some kind of war, where we have to stay in our homes or risk whatever awaits us outside. I don't know how long this will last. Trips are being canceled (I've had one to St. Louis and another to Los Angeles, and my girlfriend Seattle and Baltimore). People are stocking up on groceries and (inexplicably) water.

I'm in this weird twilight zone where life is going on in the absence of all of the things that make life normal.

I have a company mug that I've started using during work hours. I'm also drinking a lot more tea that I've kept at home for a while!

My apartment closed its fitness center, which makes my hope of exercise starting or breaking up my day a lot more challenging. I might try to start running again, but realistically I doubt it. I think I will lean on going for walks, or at least until Chicago goes under lockdown.

Keeping up with coworkers is challenging; I can't talk to them casually at our desks or in the kitchen anymore. I'm trying to mitigate this with occasional short video calls, and many of us are leaning on Slack more. We'll see how well this goes.

I'm playing Pokemon GO less, for the obvious reason of not going outside as much. This is also partially because Niantic appears to have made the March event slate [abnormally frustrating](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/fbqvi7/psa_if_the_new_march_events_are_making_you_feel/) in an attempt to see how far they can push their playerbase, and I'm one of the players who feels squeezed out. I've noticed my phone screen time go down dramatically to between 1 and 2 hours daily now.

My team exclusive of me, which consisted of 5 people in NYC, had gotten used to high-frequency casual updates and debugging by virtue of being colocated. They're finding it difficult to keep up with each other, so now we have 30 minute daily calls (long standups, essentially) to help fill this gap. This has helped me, actually, because I never experieneced the colocation benefits that they did.

Maintaining a work-life separation is challenging, now that my desk is three feet from my bed. I've done the following so far:
 * Showering and doing my hair in the mornings, like usual.
 * Put on a button up and "work pants"---which are a particular pair of comfortable sweatpants. You've gotta start somewhere.
 * Putting my laptop into my work backpack at the end of the day.
 * Changing into different clothes when I'm done working.

I didn't want to sacrifice comfort, though, so I have "work sweatpants" and "normal sweatpants." After I'm done, I change from one to the other. This has no business being this effective, to be honest.

Working a full eight-ish hours is challenging. I feel myself hitting a wall around 3:30 or 4 (after starting around 9), but I also think I'm more focused here than I am at work.

There are some bright sides: I'm expecting to have a lot more time to read, though this is obviously coming at the expense of social interaction. I'm talking to my roommate more, because he's in the same fully remote boat as me.

Investing in my remote setup was important, too. I have two monitors (one purchased, one that I brought home from my office), a [docking station](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-universal-dock-d6000/apd/452-bcyt/pc-accessories), and a wireless mouse and keyboard. The docking station works flawlessly with my USB-C Chromebook (for personal use) and Macbook Pro (for work), where it's one cable that gives me both displays, power, and peripherals. For my older personal laptop, I have to plug the monitor into the laptop directly, but I'm hoping to replace that when the rumored 14in Macbook Pro comes out.

The monitor helps my desk to be more desk-like. Previously, I was guilty of one of the cardinal sins of remote work: working from my bed. This, for me, was fine when I only worked from home on (usually slow) Fridays. Now that I'm staring down the tunnel of indefinite remote work, doing work at my desk is essential.

Sadly, this also means that I'm more tethered to my desk for personal work. Having the monitor makes it easy to have, for example, a muted Twitch stream on one screen while I write a blog post or read a paper.

I'm expecting to have more time: to play [Pokemon Mystery Dungeon](https://mysterydungeon.pokemon.com/en-us/) (which is largely responsible for my lack of activity here the last two weeks), to play Animal Crossing when it comes out, to (finally) finish Network Propaganda, to get through things on my [reading list]({{ < ref "/reading_list.md" >}}), and to do volunteer work for [Tech for Campaigns](https://www.techforcampaigns.org/). I know that setting unrealistic expectations can be dangerous, so I haven't yet created goals for how I'll allocate this time.

I'm hoping to call my friends more frequently. I can't see my usual social group in person, of course, but I also hope to talk more often with close friends who live in different cities.
