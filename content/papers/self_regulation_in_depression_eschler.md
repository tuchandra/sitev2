## Background
Much is known about how individuals with depression or other mental illnesses use social media in aggregate, and lots of work attempts to predict mental health status. Some relevant papers that I've read:
 * [Multimodal Classification of Moderated Online Pro-Eating Disorder Content]({{< ref "papers/classification_pro_ed_chancellor.md" >}})
 * ['This Post Will Just Get Taken Down': Characterizing Removed Pro-Eating Disorder Content on Social Media]({{< ref "papers/removed_pro_ed_chancellor.md" >}})
 * [Methods in predictive techniques for mental health status on social media: a critical review]({{< ref "papers/review_methods_predicting_mental_health_status_chancellor.md" >}})

This work takes a different approach: the goal is to understand *individuals*, and how they make decisions about technology use. From the abstract:

> We interviewed 30 individuals living with depression to explore their technology and social media use. We find that these individuals demonstrated emergent practices related to self-regulation, such as learning to monitor and adjust technology use to improve their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral health. Our findings add a human-centered viewpoint to the relationship between living with depression and technology and social media use. 

Past work in the mental health / technology space has found that individuals with higher levels of loneliness (defined as a cognitive state, not an objective one) tend to use Facebook more, and other work has found strong associations between depression indicators and social media use. The goal here was to better understand the role of technology and social media in the lives of individuals with depression. The guiding research question:

> How do people living with depression use technology in their day to day lives? What are some opportunities for helping people to use technology in a healthy way in the context of depression?


## Methods
These were semi-structured interviews; some questions include:

> * What are some of your goals for your quality of life and how you want to feel?
> * How do you think using technology like your phone helps with quality of life?
> * What kinds of information do you keep track of related to your moods or emotions? How do you use technology to track this information?
> * What are some times that you think it's important to avoid technology, like your phone, computer, or television? Why is it important to avoid technology?

Additionally, the interviewers  "met with one of the principal investigators—a clinical psychologist—who was able to validate the construct validity [11] of themes emerging in ongoing data collection." Great! The interviews were coded and synthesized in what seems like a standard process.


## Findings
The authors evaluate the results using the concept of "self-regulation": a "theory-based, empirically supported framework for developing psychotherapeutic interventions that complement and extend current cognitive-behavioral models," which describes a process of improving habits by focusing on personal goals. They focus on three forms of self-regulation:

 > * **Emotional self-regulation practices**: Participants’ work to formulate and/or maintain healthier emotional states related to technology and social media use, such as managing moods.
 > * **Cognitive self-regulation practices**: Thoughts that participants expressed about technology and social media use, including metacognition (thinking about thought patterns when using technology), and efforts to address negative thought patterns, such as rumination.
 > * **Behavioral self-regulation practices**: Participants’ efforts to design new behavioral habits around technology and social media use, which can lead to a positive feedback loop in maintaining all three elements of self-regulation.








## Why this matters

> In our results, we describe our participants’ strategies for self-regulating technology use to achieve goals in terms of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral health. This study contributes findings and insights about work that individuals living with depression are accomplishing on their own, typically without clinical intervention. In our discussion, we contribute a narrative focus on empowerment that can be fostered for individuals living with depression to self-regulate their technology and social media use (“power-to” help oneself; [48]), rather than describing our participants as passive individuals who are subject to the influence of technology and social media platforms.


## Reflections
This is one of the rare papers that makes me think "hey, I could do this!" The question asked is so natural, and deeply personal. The researchers are from Northwestern, where I went, and the PI is part of the [Technology and Social Behavior](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/) program that I have considered applying to. The subject is interesting, and on the whole I could *absolutely* see myself doing this kind of work.
