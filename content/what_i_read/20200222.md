## [On drafting an engineering strategy](https://www.paperplanes.de/2020/1/31/on-drafting-an-engineering-strategy.html)
**Author**: Mathias Meyer (found from Pointer)

**Summary**: this is a blog post about the actual practice of creating an organizational-wide engineering strategy, and not just on the importance of having one. Meyer spent a great deal of time listening to people throughout the engineering org, learning how people and teams had arrived at decisions, and ultimately to *find shared understanding* with the team.

Meyer defined an "objective" as "a longer term goal that requires multiple steps and likely a longer stretch of work to get it implemented fully." These should be linked to business strategy (which, especially at startups, may not always be clear). Making these open to feedback is also essential.

**Thoughts**: wow, this just makes me wish for this kind of transparency and openness in my org. A document that outlined the eng team's mission, objectives that steer the technical direction, and process improvements to make life easier would be great to have! More generally, I thrive on *context* for what I'm doing, and so understanding how my work fits into the bigger picture is helpful.
