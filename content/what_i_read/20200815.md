I'm trying to put together my first submission for a conference CFP: [PyMCon](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymcon//cfp), an all-virtual conference happening this November. This week, I sought out a lot of blog posts about this to help.

I started off by going to the blogs of two people whose writing I admire: [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) and [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/). I searched for "conferences" and "CFP", finding some general conference-related posts on Evans' blog, and [Example Call for Proposals submissions](https://lethain.com/cfp-examples/) on Larson's. The links led me to a variety of others that I'll link here.

This links to a seven-part guide about giving great tech talks. The posts [Choosing a Topic](https://medium.com/@nnja/the-ultimate-guide-to-memorable-tech-talks-part-2-choosing-a-topic-and-a-conference-b45fe6e4289a) and [Writing a CFP](https://medium.com/@nnja/the-ultimate-guide-to-memorable-tech-talks-part-3-writing-a-conference-proposal-or-cfp-7481aba78aa5) are super helpful! Her key takeaways from the CFP one are:

> * Research the conference before submitting. Look for explicit guidelines or research past talks.
> * Propose what you’re capable of delivering in a concise way.
> * Don’t be afraid of rejection. Try again.

And from Part 2:

> “I have nothing new to say, it’s all been covered” is a myth that I hear beginners perpetuate as a way to talk themselves out of speaking.

Wow, that hits home. I've wanted to speak for a long time, but it was only in the last month or so that I actually felt like I knew enough about anything to submit a CFP. We'll see how this one goes!


## Shorter articles

[Example Call for Proposals submissions](https://lethain.com/cfp-examples/) by Will Larson gives, as promised, tons of example CFP submissions! These are great to dig into. More important to me, though, is the *process* behind writing such a submission: the advice about selecting an idea, then developing it into long-form writing, is reassuring. Writing is one of my strengths.

[Writing the CFP](https://speaking.io/plan/writing-a-cfp/) from speaking.io by Zach Holman was a resource I found on Google. This post itself was not very detailed. But I'm including it here so that I remember the rest of the site, which looks amazing!

[Notes on preparing a tech talk](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/writing-a-tech-talk/) by Emily Riederer is mostly focused on writing a talk after you've been accepted to speak. Nonetheless, it is helping me to prepare for writing a CFP submission by guiding the content of my hopefully-future talk.
