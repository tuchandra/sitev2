## [Edge case poisoning](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/edge-case-poisoning/)
**Author**: Hillel Wayne

This post walks through a simple exercise: 
 * open a book of recipes, 
 * try to make a data structure that can encode that recipe, 
 * flip to another page, 
 * adjust your data structure as needed.

Predictably, this ends poorly. 
Recipes can include items in terms of their mass (150g sugar), volume (2 cups flour), or quantity (4 eggs). 
They can include edible and non-edible ingredients.
They can include other recipes as components, or even include themselves.

> I call this **edge case poisoning**. Itâ€™s almost impossible to avoid because anything dealing with the real world is going to have tons and tons of edge cases. You think handling time zones is hard? Time zones are only notorious because they are a real-world domain that we all have to deal with.

That's what real code looks like. Ouch!
Real code is about dealing with all of the awful, pesky, pervasive edge cases that arise everywhere in everything.
I can't count the number of crazy data anomalies that I've had to account for in my code, either by handling them (when possible) or (when not) designing my code in a way that bypasses the problem. 

I think a fun (for some definition of fun) exercise for a beginner learning about data structures would be to try to design data structures for progressively more complex real-world examples.
Recipes, shipping plans, TV programs, music, ... pick something and try to model it in code.
That could be educational.
