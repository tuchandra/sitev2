[Different versions of your site can be running at the same time](https://jakearchibald.com/2020/multiple-versions-same-time/) by Jake Archibald opens with the quote "it's pretty easy for a user to be running an old version of your site." If they open your site, you deploy an update, and they open a link in a new tab, they now have a different version of the site in each tab.

This is especially likely if you deploy often, have client-side navigation, or have offline-first patterns (what?). The article goes through different scenarios: a lazy-loaded script was updated between when a page loads and when a user requested it; or the script was deleted; or the API response changes; or any number of other things that I'd never thought about.

Web development sounds crazy.

[Systems design for advanced beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2020/04/06/systems-design-for-advanced-beginners/) by Robert Heaton is an *amazing* walk through system design for people who know enough about programming, but not enough about designing and building software systems. 

It starts with the basics of how web apps interact with browsers, and how a smartphone app might send requests to the same place as a browser. Then one might build a user-facing API and a client library so that power users can interact with your platform. Webhooks are requests that the server sends to a user when something happens, so it's on the user to listen for them. 

There's so much more that I can't summarize, but I read the entire thing twice through. This is great!
