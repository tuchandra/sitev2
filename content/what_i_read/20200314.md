Hello! I didn't get to read much this week because of coronavirus-related things taking up my time, and this post is more of a reflection of that than anything else.

## Other, shorter articles
[https://www.varrazzo.com/blog/2020/03/06/thinking-psycopg3](Thinking psycopg3) is by a pscyopg2 maintainer about their vision for the next major iteration of the library. Some of the changes include separating query statements and parameters, modifying the behavior of context managers and how they impact transactions, creating an optional C module, and integrating async code into the library.

The last one is most interesting to me: the very little JavaScript I've done has helped me to understand async a little better, and now it's almost a little surprising that Python libraries have so little support for async programming. Seeing things like [Requests 3](http://3.python-requests.org/) and now this attempt to integrate first-class async support makes me interested in seeing how this evolves over time.

[They started a karaoke club in their house because the internet wanted it](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/nyregion/karaoke-nyc-lions-roar.html) is an NYT article about Lion's Roar Karaoke House. In late 2012, a couple got a call from a group of strangers who wanted to sing karaoke ... at their house. The couple had previously run Lion's Roar Entertainment, but closed it in 2008; somehow, though, the defunct business started appearing at the top of Google Search results. "Maybe someone is trying to tell us something," one of them said, and so after three years of avoiding calls they went all-in and transformed their house into a karaoke house.

I found this from the MIT Technology Review newsletter [Weekend Reads](https://forms.technologyreview.com/weekend-reads/); the "tech connection" was a quote "it was like the Google algorithm was suddenly in our favor." In hindsight, that line was more of a hook into an interesting and feel-good, but by no means tech-related, story, rather than anything that has to do with algorithms.
