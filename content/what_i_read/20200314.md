Hello! I didn't get to read much this week because of coronavirus-related things taking up my time, and this post is more of a reflection of that than anything else.

## [This is how the CDC is trying to forecast coronavirus spread](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615360/cdc-cmu-forecasts-coronavirus-spread/?)
**Author**: Karen Hao

I found this from the MIT Technology Review's [Weekend Reads](https://forms.technologyreview.com/weekend-reads/) newsletter. The article discusses how the CDC partners with multiple research groups, including one from CMU, to accurately forecast the flu, and now coronavirus. The CMU group has a real-time prediction of the current number of people infected, a machine learning forecast, and a crowdsourced forecast. The latter is particularly interesting: they review a chart of trajectories of past flu seasons, and are then asked to complete the curve of the current one. In aggregate, the crowd often performs just as well as the ML forecast.

One of my favorite parts of this article was the head of the CMU group, Roni Rosenfeld, discussing his reluctance to take on the problem:

> “People act on the basis of forecasting models, whether they are on paper or in their heads,” he says. “You’re better off quantifying these estimations so you can discuss them rationally as opposed to making them based on intuition.”

I think this quote is illuminating: most people have *some* idea of how the pandemic will go, whether that's the [worst-case](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615358/worst-case-coronavirus-scenario-214-million-americans-infected-17-million-dead/) of 214 million Americans being infected or the head-in-sand "it's just a flu" folks. Having a model---*some* model---lets us at least quantify uncertainty and calibrate our expectations.

Additionally, this is actually quite similar to how FiveThirtyEight created a primary model while fully knowing it would be imperfect. Nate Silver discussed how, in the past, they thought there were too many complexities involved with modeling the entire primary elections. But he wrote something remarkably similar to what Rosenfeld did above, in ["How Our Primary Model Works"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeight-2020-primary-model-works/):

> If building a full-fledged primary model presents its share of challenges — some of which I’ll describe here — there are also plenty of problems with publishing a half-assed forecasting product. (Meanwhile, trying to navigate our way through the primaries without any sort of forecasting product would present [bigger challenges still](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-i-acted-like-a-pundit-and-screwed-up-on-donald-trump/).)

The last link goes to an article titled "How I Acted Like A Pundit And Screwed Up On Donald Trump." It is one of many articles written by people reflecting on the need for a more data-driven, rigorous approach to forecasting elections. That's not to say that "data-driven" means "good" by any means: but, as both Silver and Rosenfeld say, having a forecast that makes quantifiable predictions at least gives you something against which you can compare your mental priors.

## [How to practice social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615355/coronavirus-social-distancing-during-pandemic/)
**Authors**: Tanya Basu and Karen Hao

This is another COVID-19 related article; unsurprisingly, my reading this week has been *lot* about the present global health crisis. The basic idea is that **something is better than nothing**: there are lots of ways to be *more* responsible without completely holing up for several weeks. Maintaining your sanity is also important: mental wellness affects your immune system.

A highlight, for me, is minimizing the number of trips outside one's home. Run errands together, and during off-peak hours, and when you get home change your clothes and/or shower. The authors stress that risk reduction is better than an all-or-nothing approach: doing as much as you can to lower your risk (of contracting the disease or infecting others) is already quite good.

And [**wash your damn hands**](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html)!

## Other, shorter articles
[https://www.varrazzo.com/blog/2020/03/06/thinking-psycopg3](Thinking psycopg3) is by a pscyopg2 maintainer about their vision for the next major iteration of the library. Some of the changes include separating query statements and parameters, modifying the behavior of context managers and how they impact transactions, creating an optional C module, and integrating async code into the library.

The last one is most interesting to me: the very little JavaScript I've done has helped me to understand async a little better, and now it's almost a little surprising that Python libraries have so little support for async programming. Seeing things like [Requests 3](http://3.python-requests.org/) and now this attempt to integrate first-class async support makes me interested in seeing how this evolves over time.

[They started a karaoke club in their house because the internet wanted it](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/nyregion/karaoke-nyc-lions-roar.html) is an NYT article about Lion's Roar Karaoke House. In late 2012, a couple got a call from a group of strangers who wanted to sing karaoke ... at their house. The couple had previously run Lion's Roar Entertainment, but closed it in 2008; somehow, though, the defunct business started appearing at the top of Google Search results. "Maybe someone is trying to tell us something," one of them said, and so after three years of avoiding calls they went all-in and transformed their house into a karaoke house.

I found this from the MIT Technology Review newsletter [Weekend Reads](https://forms.technologyreview.com/weekend-reads/); the "tech connection" was a quote "it was like the Google algorithm was suddenly in our favor." In hindsight, that line was more of a hook into an interesting and feel-good, but by no means tech-related, story, rather than anything that has to do with algorithms.
