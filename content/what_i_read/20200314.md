Hello! This week's reading was TODO

## Other, shorter articles
[https://www.varrazzo.com/blog/2020/03/06/thinking-psycopg3](Thinking psycopg3) is by a pscyopg2 maintainer about their vision for the next major iteration of the library. Some of the changes include separating query statements and parameters, modifying the behavior of context managers and how they impact transactions, creating an optional C module, and integrating async code into the library.

The last one is most interesting to me: the very little JavaScript I've done has helped me to understand async a little better, and now it's almost a little surprising that Python libraries have so little support for async programming. Seeing things like [Requests 3](http://3.python-requests.org/) and now this attempt to integrate first-class async support makes me interested in seeing how this evolves over time.
