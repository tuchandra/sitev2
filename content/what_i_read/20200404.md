This week's reading included TODO.

I also spent a fair amount of time reading the book *Everybody Lies* by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz. See my [initial thoughts]({{< ref "/books/everybody_lies_1.md" >}}), followed by more abstract posts where I reflected on [what data science means]({{< ref "/books/everybody_lies_2.md" >}}) and [the dangers of big data]({{< ref "/books/everybody_lies_3.md" >}}).


## [Why it's so freaking hard to make a good COVID-19 model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/)
**Authors**: Maggie Koerth, Laura Bronner and Jasmine Mithani (at FiveThirtyEight)

This is a fantastic post about the difficulties in modeling the spread of COVID-19 (and also a reason for why FiveThirtyEight isn't even going to try, which I agree is the right decision).

The post starts simple: the number of people who will die is a function of how many people the virus is capable of infecting, how many people it does infect, and how many people it kills. Well, none of those numbers are none, and it turns out you have to model each of them, too.

The number of people the virus will infect is a function of how much it spreads by cough and fluids, how long it lives on surfaces, what the incubation period is, how long people can spread the virus to others, whether or not people can get reinfected, how many people act as "superspreaders," how much various social distancing measures work (which itself varies by country, state, and city), how dense cities are, how good people's immune systems are, which people we test, how many people we test, how accurate the tests are, what happens when people receive a positive result, how long they isolate for, and several dozen other things that I didn't account for.

All of those go into estimating R0 (the reproduction number). The other parts of any model are equally complicated. Modeling any of these without deep epidemiological experience is asking for disaster, and it's why I think data scientists need to sit this one out and let the actual experts handle this.


## [Webcam Hacking - Technical Walkthrough](https://www.ryanpickren.com/webcam-hacking)
**Author**: Ryan Pickren

Apple recently [paid out](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/04/03/iphone-camera-hijacked-using-three-zero-days-apple-pays-hacker-75000/#7993fd5e4f91) $75,000 to a white-hat hacker who uncovered 7 zero-day exploits in Safari, three of which could be used to gain control of a user's webcam. The author details the exploits and the discovery process in this blog post.

The final process is this:

> 1. Open evil HTTP website
>
> 2. HTTP website becomes a data: URI
>
> 3. data: URI becomes a blob: URI (with magic blank origin)
>
> 4. Manipulate window.history (in 2 parts!)
>
> 5. Create an about:blank iframe and document.write to it
>
> 6. Dynamically give this iframe the sandbox attribute
>
> 7. Attempt an impossible frame navigation using X-Frame-Options
>
> 8. From within the iframe, window.open a new popup and document.write to it

This was a great read; there were a few things that went over my head, but on the whole the author explained the process of discovering these vulnerabilities quite clearly. Honestly, while reading this, I was simply amazed at the level of detective work going on. Pickren was digging through specs trying to find inconsistencies and ambiguities, then seeing how Safari implemented them. There's a screen-recorded demo at the bottom, and it's pretty wild.
