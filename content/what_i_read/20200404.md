## [Why it's so freaking hard to make a good COVID-19 model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/)
**Authors**: Maggie Koerth, Laura Bronner and Jasmine Mithani (at FiveThirtyEight)

This is a fantastic post about the difficulties in modeling the spread of COVID-19 (and also a reason for why FiveThirtyEight isn't even going to try, which I agree is the right decision).

The post starts simple: the number of people who will die is a function of how many people the virus is capable of infecting, how many people it does infect, and how many people it kills. Well, none of those numbers are none, and it turns out you have to model each of them, too.

The number of people the virus will infect is a function of how much it spreads by cough and fluids, how long it lives on surfaces, what the incubation period is, how long people can spread the virus to others, whether or not people can get reinfected, how many people act as "superspreaders," how much various social distancing measures work (which itself varies by country, state, and city), how dense cities are, how good people's immune systems are, which people we test, how many people we test, how accurate the tests are, what happens when people receive a positive result, how long they isolate for, and several dozen other things that I didn't account for.

All of those go into estimating R0 (the reproduction number). The other parts of any model are equally complicated. Modeling any of these without deep epidemiological experience is asking for disaster, and it's why I think data scientists need to sit this one out and let the actual experts handle this.
