[Lessons learnt in year three as a software engineer][https://shubheksha.com/posts/2020/08/lessons-learnt-in-year-three-as-a-software-engineer] by Shubheksha is exactly what it sounds like: some nuggets of advice for people in roughly my stage of their careers. Some highlights:
 * Marketing your work to the right people is a critical skill, almost moreso than doing the work itself
 * "Titles give you legitimacy, especially when you don't enjoy the privilege of being assumed to be competent"
 * Sponsors can open doors for you, give you confidence, and help you progress much faster

This was great. I'll have to pay more attention to this person's blog!
