## [A penguin-fish recommender systems using multi-armed bandits, pt. 1](https://sebastiancallh.github.io/post/multi-armed-bandits-and-penguins/)
**Author**: Sebastian Callh

**Summary**: this long post motivates, introduces, and implements multi-armed bandits for the problem of deciding which of three fish to feed three species of penguins. I've read a little bit about multi-armed bandits, but this was a simple but concrete application that I learned a lot from.

One of the things I appreciated about this post is that it was written in Julia. This made me less able to follow the code than if it were written in Python, but I was exposed to non-trivial Julia code for the first time. I would love to try out the language some time.
