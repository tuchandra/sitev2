It's back to usual this week, as I try to create a healthy work-life balance while working from home indefinitely. This week's articles focus on TODO.

[Journey into observability: Glitch's journey](https://mads-hartmann.com/sre/2020/03/05/journey-into-observability-glitchs-journey.html) is a discussion about how Glitch started investing into observability and what they have or haven't done. They started investing in observability because their logs and traces weren't useful for debugging production incidents, nor for answering sophisticated questions. They suggest that one of the benefits is being able to disprove hypotheses more quickly, which usually results in faster solutions. This is interesting, but it doesn't sound like observability will be a focus of my reading in the near term.
