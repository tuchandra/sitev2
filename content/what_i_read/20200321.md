It's back to usual this week, as I try to create a healthy work-life balance while working from home indefinitely. This week's articles focus on TODO.

## [Work in the Time of Corona](https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/work-in-the-time-of-corona/)
**Author**: Alice Goldfuss

This is a blog post giving advice on maintaining one's mental health while working remotely. The highlight is that **it's okay to feel bad**: switching to full remote is challenging to begin with, and the reality of the current situation is unusual stressful on top of that. Goldfuss writes "if you are feeling bad, reconnect with the world," suggesting that going for walks and observing the world can help to overcome feelings of isolation.

> If you’re having a terrible time right now, that’s completely fair. But please keep in mind that you are abruptly working from home under stressful circumstances.

Other suggestions:

 * **Recreate your rhythm**: in an office, you get dressed in the morning, commute to work, and have a dedicated desk. Maintaining these, by putting on "work clothes" and starting your day with a walk, can help to ramp up into a work mindset.
 * Keep your workspace clean; clutter impacts mental health.
 * Have a secondary work area (the kitchen, living room, etc.), especially if you move from your desk in an office.
 * Have snacks and drinks, and eat lunch (again, just like work)
 * Stop working! At the end of the day, put your computer away, take another walk, change into different clothes, and do other things to signal the shift away from work.

The author also suggests to **create social spaces**, which is the hardest challenge of working remotely; the lack of spontaneous interactions and idle chit-chat is often understated. She suggests scheduling time for unstructured conversations---even 15 minutes---or having a weekly social hour with people you are close to.

> Above all, please monitor your general mental health and make adjustments as needed. Be kind to yourself and others. We are in this together.

**Thoughts**: this was great. I shared it with my coworkers and many of them appreciated it. I think the most important piece to remember is that **this isn't normal**: that remote work doesn't usually come with the increased anxiety from COVID-19. While Nielsen already had a strong remote culture, we weren't remote-first; many of us still relied on office chit-chat, or casual updates on each other's work. 


## [Creativity in Academia](https://timdettmers.com/2019/09/03/creativity-in-academia/)
**Author** Tim Dettmers

This is a reflection on what it means to be creative, and how to foster creativity in research contexts. "Not coming up with good ideas" is an essential part of creativity, the author writes, suggesting that only after you've seen what doesn't work can you come up with solutions that nobody else is seeing. Perhaps counterintuitively, abandoning ideas can also be an element of creativity: not thinking about an idea actively can help your unconscious mind to process it.

The author also suggests working on many ideas at once. This can help to create connections between seemingly unrelated work items, while also giving your mind a break from thinking about the same thing repeatedly. 

**Thoughts**: I've experienced all of this myself on countless occasions. Working on two or three things at once is definitely good for my overall idea generation and productivity; it feels easy to get trapped in a creativity slump when focusing on one particular problem for a long time.

I've found meditation and journaling to help me with creativity. Meditation helps to clear my head and focus my thoughts, and short of full meditations the skill of being able to center myself is helpful too. Journaling, meanwhile, helps me to be more deliberate: the act of putting pencil to paper forces me to slow down my brain.


## Other, shorter articles
[Journey into observability: Glitch's journey](https://mads-hartmann.com/sre/2020/03/05/journey-into-observability-glitchs-journey.html) is a discussion about how Glitch started investing into observability and what they have or haven't done. They started investing in observability because their logs and traces weren't useful for debugging production incidents, nor for answering sophisticated questions. They suggest that one of the benefits is being able to disprove hypotheses more quickly, which usually results in faster solutions. This is interesting, but it doesn't sound like observability will be a focus of my reading in the near term.

[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction.html) by Dr. Kristie Whitaker (and [others](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction.html#The-Turing-Way-Community)) is not something that I can summmarize, so it goes in this section.. Rather, it's a "lightly opinionated" guide to reproducible data science. Its contents include open research, version control, data management, environment management, testing, reviewing, and more. This looks like a great reference to point people to, though perhaps a little overwhelming at first. 

Of particular interest is a section on Makefiles, which I've found in [other](https://blog.mindlessness.life/2019/11/17/the-language-agnostic-all-purpose-incredible-makefile.html) [guides](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.repo_name%20%7D%7D/Makefile) to reproducible data science and software engineering, and started using more myself. I use Make to build [this website](https://github.com/tuchandra/sitev2/blob/master/Makefile), and look forward to incorporating it into more of my workflows.
