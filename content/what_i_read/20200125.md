## [Data science is different now](http://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/)
**Author**: Vicki Boykis

**How I found this**: I think Twitter?

**Summary**: this is a long post about the recent history and current state of data science. The thesis is that there's an important problem in data science: "an oversupply of junior data scientists hoping to enter the industry, and mismatched expectations on what they can hope to find once they do get that coveted title of data scientist."

Boykis discusses at length the glut of aspiring data scientists trying to break into the field, citing the explosion of MOOCs, rise of bootcamps, and even the creation of data science degrees by universities. She goes on to talk about unrealistic expectations for what "data science" isâ€”everyone wants to do modeling, and no one wants to do data cleaning. It's also become clearer that data science is largely engineering, and that these skills are very important.

She closes the post with advice to aspiring data scientists: don't aim for a data science job (there aren't very many and you have a lot of competition), then learn the skills needed for data science (SQL, a programming language, and cloud skills). "Pick a small piece of something and start there. Do something small. Learn something small, build something small."

**Thoughts**: this is a great post. I haven't found many resources that discuss the state of data science with as much nuance as this one. The advice that "your first job might not be a data science job" is some of the best I've seen, and the list of problems is remarkably comprehensive. It furthers my belief that data science requires strong [engineering skills]({{< ref "/posts/software_in_dsci.md" >}}) with a data background; whether that's more stats, visualization, or modeling is less important.
