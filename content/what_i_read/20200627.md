## [CS education in higher education](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15UxfJnjI8P0N33xGlTqY1A39SQdxBUwQ2jflkVMmF7Q/edit#slide=id.gc6f980f91_0_0)
**Author**: Amy J. Ko, PhD (professor at the University of Washington)

**Summary**: these are the slides from a talk last week about CS in higher education, and in particular the historical injustices and exclusion that helps students to fail.

Higher education, generally speaking, is in crisis: funding for public universities has been declining, and the pandemic is exacerbating budget shortfalls. "The only parts of academia that are fiscally resilient are CS, business, and more popular science and engineering disciplines."

CS today is "everything"---its dominance in industry translates to its dominance in academia (where, for example, Northwestern's introductory course was taken by 25% of the student body). Why, then, are students failing?
 1. Students believe programmers are born, not made (fixed mindset)---guess what kinds of students this favors?
 2. Students don't see how programming will help them to solve the problems they care about (health, education, justice)
 3. Students face sexism, racism, ableism, elitism
 4. Pedagogy on programming languages is pretty bad (lecture on syntax, give problem sets; no understanding of semantics or addressing misconceptions therein). This is exacerbated by (3), where some students don't feel safe seeking support from arrogant or posturing peers
 5. Classes move too fast.

The pandemic is amplifying existing inequities. Students who relied on campus housing, computer labs, informal peer learning, or in-person community structures no longer have them. It's also amplifying poor teaching skills, which CS faculty generally lack. Teaching more students makes feedback harder. And, finally, faculty are realizing that CS is broken in these ways.

**Thoughts**: this is great, and really hits home. This addresses many of the problems I noticed in six quarters of TAing CS classes at Northwestern. The best professor I had (as both a student and TA) had a strict "no posturing" policy for everyone in her class, which by itself did a lot to make students feel more comfortable asking questions and speaking up. Northwestern also employed a small army of undergrad TAs (like me) to help close the gap between the up-to-400-person lectures and the largely individual problem sets. These helped, but there were deeper, more fundamental problems that these slides do a great job of going into.
