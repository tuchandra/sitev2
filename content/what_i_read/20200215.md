## [Why procrastination is about managing your emotions, not time](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200121-why-procrastination-is-about-managing-emotions-not-time)
**Author**: Christian Jarrett

**How I found this**: a friend sent it to me

**Summary**: the conventional wisdom about procrastination is that it's a matter of time management, or that if you get better at scheduling and estimating the time that different things will take, then you will procrastinate less. More recent research is suggesting that it's more about managing our emotions, though, and that the act of procrastinating makes us feel worse, so we cope with that by doing other things to make us feel better.

Of course, this is a vicious cycle. While procrastination is an effective distraction, it can lead to guilt that compounds the initial stress, and lead to the feeling of hours having escaped from you. The flip side is that because it's an emotional regulation issue, research on cognitive behavioral therapy can help us to address it. One offshoot is "acceptance & committment therapy" (ACT):

> ACT teaches the benefits of ‘psychological flexibility’ – that is, being able to tolerate uncomfortable thoughts and feelings, staying in the present moment in spite of them, and prioritising choices and actions that help you get closer to what you most value in life.

**Thoughts**: this is absolutely consistent with my experience. I love the idea of ACT, which to me is related to the ideas behind mindfulness meditation: noticing and accepting your emotions, but not letting them govern your actions. Combating procrastination for me is primarily a function of overcoming the lurking anxiety that makes me put something off. Starting to do *anything* makes it easier to continue, and so I've also found it effective to start the easiest thing first.

## [FiveThirtyEight: the state of the polls](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-state-of-the-polls-2019)
**Author**: Nate Silver

**Summary**: this article brings together lots of research about the accuracy & state of election polls since the 2016 Presidential election. Highlights include:

 * Polls have been "quite accurate" in post-2016 elections, saying that the weighted average error in the 21 days before elections was only 5 points (compared to the overall average of 5.8 points)
 * Polls call the right winner 79% of the time; this is ~77% since 2010, and upwards of 80% before then, but this due to there being more close elections recently
 * In races with a margin smaller than 3 points, polls identify the winner 58% of the time; better than random, but not much.
 * Polling bias is *not* consistent from cycle to cycle; the 2015 - 2016 cycle had a 3 point bias towards Democrats, but 2017 - 2019 is 0.3 points to Republicans. More generally, whatever bias is present in one cycle isn't present in the next.

Silver continues talking about their pollster ratings and different ways that they detect "herding" (when pollsters massage their results to match those of other pollsters). There are other methodological changes that they've made to their pollster ratings, which are not as interesting to me but certainly critical to the accuracy of their election models.



## Other, shorter articles
[Sample size determination using historical data and simulation](https://blog.ivanukhov.com/2019/09/25/bootstrap.html) is a simulation-based approach for figuring out how large an experiment's sample size needs to be in order to detect a certain effect. One must specify the levels of statistical & practical significance, and the effect size, and simulation does the rest. This is useful for cases where historical data is available (common) or where the assumptions of normal statistical tests are not met (very common!).

["Knowledge Production" vs. the Conservation and Growth of Knowledge](https://blog.cbs.dk/inframethodology/?p=2248) is a short post about the purpose of university research. The author argues that universities were never intended to "produce" or even to innovate; rather, they exist to conserve what we know by also learning more. "The universities were there to pass what we already know on to those who are capable of knowing it but do not yet know it." This, plus the cultivation of curiosity in generations of students, is the function of universities.
