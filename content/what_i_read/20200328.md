[Building a more accurate time service at Facebook scale](https://engineering.fb.com/production-engineering/ntp-service/) is an article from Facebook engineering talking about how they built a service (time.facebook.com) to sync time across many computers at sub-millisecond precision. The post starts by describing why leap seconds are awful, and the most popular approach for handling them is to "smear" the second across multiple hours. They go into great detail about their four-layer architecture and make me thankful that I have chosen a career in which I will never have to build a time service myself.
