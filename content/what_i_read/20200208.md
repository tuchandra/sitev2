## [An Opinionated Guide to ML Research](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html)
**Author**: John Schulman

**How I found this**: /r/machinelearning

**Summary**: Schulman is a research scientist and founding member of OpenAI. This post is advice to aspiring researchers, and his keys to success are "working on the right problems, making continual progress on them, and achieving continual personal growth."

 * *Working on the right problems*: this is primarily advice on how to pick the right problems. Read a lot of papers (critically!), work in a group, talk to experienced researchers, and spend time reflecting on what is useful. He also discusses the differences between idea-driven and goal-driven research.
 * *Making continual progress*: this is advice on developing a long-term habit of problem solving. He suggests keeping a lab notebook with ideas, results, and what was worked on, and reviewing it periodically. He addresses the question of when to switch problems, and that in his experience switching too frequently is more often a problem than not switching enough.
 * *Personal development*: the author recommends reading textbooks (even outside of school, because they cover topics broadly) and PhD theses (which usually have lots of background information), along with seminal papers to understand the frontiers of the field. The "less exceptional" papers are also worth keeping an eye on to understand what ideas are being tried out. 

**Thoughts**: there's a lot of great advice packed in here. Keeping a lab notebook has been extremely helpful to me in helping me remember what I've worked on and what ideas I have (or had ages ago). I like the strategy of reviewing the notebook into a summary every couple of weeks, since I feel like this would help me to maintain a coherent research direction.

The advice on switching problems also hits close to me. While my problems at work are defined by my team and the business, the methods I use aren't; and I can think of a couple of occasions when I was too quick to abandon a method that still showed a little bit of promise. I'm trying now to be more intentional about what ideas I try out and what I leave for later.
