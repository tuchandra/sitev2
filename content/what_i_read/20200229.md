Happy leap year! Highlights from this week include articles about Section 230, one of the most important laws about the internet.

## [Why the internet's most important law exists and how people are still getting it wrong](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700605/section-230-internet-law-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-jeff-kosseff-interview)
**Author**: Adi Robertson (from The Verge)

**How I found this**: my girlfriend shared it with me

**Summary**: this is an interview with Jeff Kosseff, author of [*The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet*](https://www.jeffkosseff.com/home). Those words refer to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act:

> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

The history of this law goes back to 1950: a bookstore owner was jailed for having an erotic novel in the store, under an LA law that said if you have obscene material in your store you can be held responsible. The Supreme Court struck down this ordinance, saying that there's no way a distributor could review all of their content before selling it.

Fast forward forty years, and early internet services have emerged. One platform didn't moderate content at all, and another did; when both were sued for defamation, judges held that the first was *not* liable because they were just a distributor. The second was held liable, though, because they at some level curated their content. **"You get this really weird rule where these online platforms can reduce their liability by not moderating content."**

Those cases set the scene for Section 230. The motivator was precisely that Congress wanted platforms to moderate content, and not to be these neutral "anything goes" spaces. The interview continued by describing the political discussion surrounding Section 230 today, where the idea of "neutrality" is more hotly debated.

**Thoughts**: this is a really interesting history, and I'm looking forward to reading the [book](https://www.jeffkosseff.com/home) as probably the next one on my reading list, assuming I ever finish Network Propaganda.

The intersection between Section 230 and the nebulous idea of "neutrality" is, to me, the most interesting. I've written [previously]({{< ref "posts/talk_kidd_neurips.md" >}}) that there's no such thing as a neutral platform, at least algorithmically speaking. Meanwhile, Kosseff spoke with the architects of Section 230, who said they didn't intend for platforms to be neutral. "They wanted platforms to feel free to make these judgments without risking the liability that Prodigy faced."

Now, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are in hot water with both parties, but for different reasons. Democrats seem to believe that they're not moderating enough (by e.g., Facebook allowing false political ads, the rampant spread of misinformation on Twitter, and potential radicalization pathways on YouTube), whereas Republicans believe they're censoring right-wing views.

Both miss the core point: a platform *can't* be neutral, at least when content is shown algorithmically, nor should it be. Twitter choosing not to allow political ads is a decision that likely hurts less well-known candidates; choosing to keep them would likely result in false advertising. Both are decisions with impacts, and neither is "neutral." No one [seems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3351095.3372879) to [know](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11211) what YouTube's recommendation algorithm does, but it doesn't matter; *any* recommendation algorithm they use will implicitly assign value judgments to different types of content. It's impossible for these platforms to be neutral in the age of algorithmic content curation.

And cynically, Republicans clamoring for "neutrality" gets at the heart of one of my major issues with the party: that they've politicized facts. Things like climate change and the importance of vaccinations are well-established scientifically, and there's no "both sides" to this debate. The same applies to other things that have mountains of evidence---of Russian interference in elections, or of Trump's long list of crimes. Demanding neutrality suggests that both sides are on equal footing to begin with, which is not the case for a number of the party's beliefs.

Requiring the FTC to "certify" neutrality among big tech platforms (read: Facbeook, YouTube, and Twitter), as Sen. Hawley [proposed](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18684219/josh-hawley-section-230-facebook-youtube-twitter-content-moderation) last year, therefore, is bound to fail. Repealing the act entirely, as Vice President Biden [suggests](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070403/joe-biden-president-election-section-230-communications-decency-act-revoke), would essentially kill the platforms entirely; moderating content at the scale of Facebook or Reddit is impossible. There are legitimate criticisms of these platforms, to be sure---the lack of transparency into algorithmic feeds is my primary one---but conflating neutrality, transparency, and accountability misses the heart of the issue.
