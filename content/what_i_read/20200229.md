## [Data scientists, the only useful code is production code](https://thuijskens.github.io/2018/11/13/useful-code-is-production-code/)
**Author**: Thomas Huijskens

**How I found this**: linked in a separate [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/kedro-prepare-to-pimp-your-pipeline-f8f68c263466) by QuantumBlack that I was reading as part of interview prep

**Summary**: the author posits that production code is any code that feeds a business process. This includes ad-hoc analyses that inform financial decisions, reports that are automated and sent out weekly, and (most commonly understood as "production code") modeling pipelines. Code is a main product or byproduct of a data scientist's work, and so its quality is paramount. The post goes on to include recommendations for writing good code, which I encourage anyone interested to read for themselves.

**Thoughts**: this is a more extreme version of what I wrote in [Software Engineering is an Essential Part of Data Science]({{< ref "posts/software_in_dsci.md" >}}), and I wholeheartedly agree. I'd never thought of ad-hoc analyses as production code, but extending that definition to anything that *might* need repeating seems prudent. Having a "software-first" mindset is critical to being an effective data scientist.
