## [Tons of Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/)
This one is a little unconventional ... but I read tons of Hugo documentation this week as I worked on moving my website over to it. I basically decided that I was tired of my custom SSG. While writing it was a good experience for me, and a fun side project, I realized that I wanted more functionality for my website than I could feasibly build myself. Things like custom themes, an automatic index page, and post categories were becoming challenging to write because of my inexperience in web development, and it was taking away from actually reading things I wanted to.

I found the Hugo documentation to be comprehensive and reasonably easy to work with. It was comprehensive in the sense that everything I was using was documented *somewhere*; I was able to download a canned theme and look up all the commands and magic that it used. It also was not challenging to figure out where to make changes, where to remove features I didn't need, and more.

I have not found as much of a community around Hugo as I have other tools, like PyMC3 or Pyro. After reading a couple of Github issues on the repo, it seemed that people were often dismissive of problems or of gaps in the documentation. This [issue comment](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4428#issuecomment-366822835) is one example, and I saw other similar instances around. Of course, Hugo is someone's passion project, and they have no obligation to help others, and any time they do put is time that they volunteer ... yet I can't help wonder about this attitude that I see more and more in open source software. What can we do to help?
