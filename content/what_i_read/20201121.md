**[Proof our work-life balance is in danger (but there’s still hope)](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/teamwork/data-analysis-length-of-workday-covid/) by Arik Friedman**, on the Atlassian blog, shows a couple of compelling visualizations suggesting that people's workdays have been getting longer since COVID started.
The average workday in the United States was 30 minutes longer in April & May relative to four months prior.
And in India, it was 32 minutes; in Israel, 47.
This compares January / February to April / May; I'm curious about what those numbers look like today.

> Over half of respondents said it’s harder now to maintain work-life boundaries than before the pandemic, and 23% reported thinking about work during their off-hours more than they used to.

I think this was a great example of a data science blog post.
It showed clear, easy to understand findings.
It was focused while still providing enough background on the data sources & limitations.
And the visualizations were really compelling and told a whole story themselves.

**[How do you write simple explanations without sounding condescending?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/11/15/simple-explanations-without-sounding-condescending/) by Julia Evans** gives some tips for explaining complicated topics.
Julia Evans' blog was one of the big inspirations for me to start writing regularly, so I'm always happy to read her advice.

I love "use *some* jargon to give the reader search terms," because explanations without jargon have to stand alone and are harder to connect with other work out there.
And "write (mostly) true explanations" helps by exposing gaps in my own knowledge and forcing me not to *over*simplify something complicated.
