## [Python 3.9 Compatibility Channges](https://tirkarthi.github.io/programming/2020/01/27/python-39-changes.html/)
**Author**: Karthikeyan Singaravelan

**How I found this**: /r/programming

**Summary**: this is a post about the backwards-incompatible changes being made in Python 3.9. The idea is that a lot of `DeprecationWarning`s will finally be enforced, but this is predictably going to break lots of packages. This led to a thread on the [python-dev mailing list](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/thread/EYLXCGGJOUMZSE5X35ILW3UNTJM3MCRE/) asking for some of these to be postponed to Python 3.10, because the burden of supporting both 2.7 and 3.9 at once is too high.

**My thoughts**: this is tough. On one hand, these deprecation warnings have been emitted since 2014 (Python 3.4), and saying "update your code in the next half decade" is IMO a reasonable thing to ask of your users. On the other, library maintainers often work in their spare time, are largely volunteers, and more generally have little obligation to do *any* of this work.

I'm lucky to be in a position at work where I can generally use new technologies. Because data science is the research arm of Nielsen, we typically have agency to use whatever versions of languages and libraries we want. For my current position, a solo research project, this means I regularly upgrade my libraries as new versions are released. I recognize that this is not at all the norm.
