Part 3 of the book *Network Propaganda* is titled "The Usual Suspects," and its focus is on the propaganda culprits who received sustained public attention. Chapter 7 focuses on the alt-right; chapter 8 Russian information operations; and chapter 9 Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.

Political communciation, the authors argue, focuses on three mechanisms by which media influences politics: agenda setting (which questions are salient?), priming (what standards should we use to assess people or positions?), and framing (the context within which claims are made, and how that influences our understanding or attitudes). The right-wing media (successfully) framed immigration in terms of fear of Muslims, not Latin American immigration, which led to the travel ban in Trump's first week.

## [Ch. 7] The Propaganda Pipeline: Hacking the Core from the Periphery
This brief chapter studies the "propaganda pipeline" that transmits outlandish narratives from the periphery of a media ecosystem to its core. 

The chapter's focus is a truly bizarre set of stories claiming that the Clinton campaign chair attended a "Spirit dinner," where recipes "included breast milk and sperm," and that said chair was a Wiccan practicing literal magic. It began from the WikiLeaks emails, then was amplified by a variety of sources as it became more and more imaginative. (By the end, Redditors were claiming that the term "pizza" was code for sex trafficking children.)

The pipeline was evident: this effort drew in Russians, alt-right reporters, WikiLeaks' Facebook and Twitter accounts, and Reddit and 4chan users, before eventually making it to Sean Hannity on Fox News. But the amplification depended on WikiLeaks and then the major nodes in the right-wing media network, not dedicated alt-right actors.

> Our observations lead us to believe that those efforts, while real and observable, were not determinative in the election or the first year of the Trump presidency. ... The top media outlets and political elites, not Redditors or meme propagators from the alt-right, were primarily responsible for distributing these frames [of Islamophobia and Clinton's emails] widely. 


## [Ch. 8] Are the Russians Coming?
Chapter 8 studies the claim that Russia mounted (dis)information operations in the United States. Its conclusion is that "evidence of Russian interference is strong, but that the evidence of its impact is scant."


> What we observe is that **Russian efforts take advantage of existing fissures and pathways.** ... The insular, domestically produced network of sites and social media diffusion networks that traffic in politically motivated falsehoods, coupled with the persistent attacks on mainstream media and other evidence-based institutions and expertise, have made the right wing of the American media ecosystem more susceptible to penetration, less resilient, and less capable of self-correction. **When Russian propaganda efforts are consistent with right-wing American framings and beliefs, these falsehoods are able to insert themselves, propagate, and gain credence in the right-wing media ecosystem.** By contrast, similar efforts aimed to leverage left-wing biases have to overcome the basic checks provided by a media ecosystem inhabited by professional-norms-oriented media outlets.

Russian information campaigns did not start in 2016: one journalist first observed "Internet brigades" within Russian media in 2003. The now-infamous Internet Research Agency (IRA) was registered in 2013, and reported on by Russian investigative reporters who were critical of their government. And in March 2015, the European Council identified dangers of Russian information operations in Eastern Europe.

The chapter continues with a walk through common techniques. I'm *heavily* summarizing here, as this is some ten pages in the book with a variety of examples:

 * **Hacking and doxxing**: hacking into email accounts or computers, and obtaining then leaking compromising information, is a technique Russian propagandists have repeatedly used. In the US, the most famous example was the hack of the DNC emails.
 * **Social media sockpuppets, bots, cyborgs, and ads**: the core strategy was to "increase disaffection, distrust, and polarization," often by boosting the white-identity vote or diverting the left to Jill Stein. Mueller found that the IRA infiltrated social media through false accounts, either fully automated (bots), humans pretending to be someone else (sockpuppets), or a combination (cyborgs). They used all major tech platforms, though the platforms said that this was a tiny fraction of overall activity.
 * **White propaganda, grey propaganda, and useful idiots**: white propaganda was from a known partisan outlet; grey propaganda was somewhere between that and outright lies and falsely described sources; useful idiots were *actual* local media who happened to pick up Russian-developed narratives. 

The authors underscore the point that one would have to be willfully blind or complicit to deny that Russia had been attacking the American media. They warn, however:

> But evidence of sustained effort is not the same as evidence of impact or prevalence. **It would be profoundly counterproductive to embrace the narrative that we can no longer know what is true because of Russian bots, sockpuppets, or shady propaganda.** Indeed, having us adopt that attitude would mark a remarkable success for that Russian effort: the success in denying democracy one of its core pillars—the capacity to have a public debate based on some sense of a shared reality and trust in institutions.

The authors continue by describing the effects of the efforts above:

 * **Hacking emails**: the direct goal was to split Sanders supporters from Clinton, but this largely failed. The media ecosystem on the left did not follow the same propaganda feedback loop that the right-wing media does, and most of the "emails" coverage was driven by Fox News independent of the DNC leak.
 * **Infiltrating social media**: one allegation from Mueller was that a Russian-controlled Twitter account injected the "voter fraud" term into the media ecosystem, on August 11 and November 2. Careful analysis reveals that the summer spike was due to (1) a Reddit AMA bu Trump himself, (2) three states striking down voter ID laws, and (3) a Trump rally, in quick succession. Likewise, the November incident was due to a viral Trump tweet.
 * **Using social media to suppress and split Democrats**: in short, it is again difficult to conclude that efforts to divert black voters to Jill Stein (or stop them from voting) were successful. Facebook would be able to resolve this question fairly conclusively if they wished, the authors add, suggesting that they make available datasets of (appropriately anonymized or aggregated) targeted advertising for researchers to study.
* **Twitter bots**: finding Russian bots is hard, because the weakest link in any machine learning approach will be the training set. The authors write that even the state-of-the-art projects, while by definition the best at what they do, should not be the basis for reporting that some large percentage of Twitter activity are bots. And even then, the more important question is one of effect, and there's *still* no evidence to suggest that bots helped amplify propaganda in any meaningful way.

Identifying attempts at Russian interference is indeed important, but one must not forget that in order for these efforts to be influential, they have to make their way through the American media ecosystem. The mainstream media is, by design, resilient to Russian propaganda; the right-wing media, however, does not see the Russian origin of a story as a reason to ignore it. "Willing embrace of divisive Russian propaganda, not innocent error because of Twitter and Facebook manipulation, is the core challenge."

The closing remarks of this chapter are excellently put:

> The most important implication is for American conservatives ... There is mounting evidence that “the Fox News effect” has given the Republican Party a clear edge in the past several election cycles. There is, it seems, a clear short-term partisan advantage of going along with the style and focus of these right-wing media outlets. But competition among outlets seeking to attract conservative audiences has resulted in a feedback cycle, as sites vie to produce more outrage and anger and get ever more extreme in their framing. ... This competitive dynamic among right-wing media increases the shrill, conspiracy-tainted tone and content of coverage and makes right-wing audiences ever more susceptible to manipulation.
> 
> The result is a United States that is vulnerable to disinformation campaigns, both foreign and domestic. That susceptibility does not come from Russia, though Russia clearly has been trying to exploit it. That susceptibility does not come from Facebook, though Facebook has clearly been a primary vector online. **It comes from three decades of divergent media practices and consumption habits that have left a large number of Americans, overwhelmingly on the right of the political spectrum, vulnerable to disinformation and ready to believe the worst, as long as it lines up with their partisan identity.** And that susceptibility should be, in the long term, unacceptable to conservatives every bit as much as it is to all other Americans despite its short-term electoral benefits.






## Closing thoughts
This entire section, and particularly the chapter on Russia, is the basis for the authors' central point: that long-term media dynamics, not the alt-right, nor Russia, nor Facebook, were responsible for the radicalization of the American right and the election of Donald Trump. Suggesting that such actors contributed to these events misses the point. And in the case of Russia, it's exactly what they want: to feed generalized distrust.
