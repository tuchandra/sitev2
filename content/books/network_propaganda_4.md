## Recap: the internet is not causing polarization
Let's recap one of the main points from the first three parts of the book: if "the internet" is causing polarization and extremism, then we should expect to see rough symmetry between the left and  right within the media ecosystem. This is not the case.

Instead, we see a mixed-media center-left that engages ~70% of the population, along with an increasing radicalization of the right ~30%. Moreover, the political science literature argues against the idea that the internet caused polarization. The left-and-center do not parallel the right.

> These facts are as inconvenient to academics seeking a nonpartisan, neutral diagnosis of what is happening to us as they are to professional journalists who are institutionally committed to describe the game in a nonpartisan way. Both communities have tended to focus on technology, we believe, because if technology is something that happens to all of us, no partisan finger pointing is required. But the facts we observe do not lend themselves to a neutral, “both sides at fault” analysis.

I've said it before, and it applies here, too: technology isn't neutral. Media isn't neutral. There are no neutral explanations for what is happening to society, which is a function of deeply rooted power structures and shifts therein.


## [Ch. 10] Polarization in American Politics
The authors write:

> This chapter reviews the political science literature on polarization, showing that polarization in American politics long precedes the internet and results primarily from asymmetric political-elite-driven dynamics. 

They present this graphic of partisanship in voting patterns for the US House from 1949 to 2011, which shows that while polarization is stark right now, it's been steadily increasing since long before the internet.

This was largely due to party dynamics surrounding the New Deal and, later, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The former, the authors note, relied on compromise between Northern Democrats and Southern Democrats (who didn't want to undermine Jim Crow), and as these dynamics eroded as part of realignment following 1964, polarization increased.

The above is polarization among elites; there is less consensus about whether the *public* is polarized. (Congress being more polarized could be due to the public voting in more extreme candidates, or due to there being fewer moderate candidates.) 

How much does this affect the large part of the population that doesn't pay regular attention to politics? (What a privilege.) "A large majority of Americans do not have consistent and reliable ideological beliefs," the authors write, a finding that has been replicated many times. Self-reported ideology does not predict opinions on many topic (immigration, gun control, foreign policy, and more); and they only predict abortion and LGBTQ rights when not controlling for religion.

The chapter concludes with a discussion about voter theory, including how people make voting decisions, develop policy preferences, and feel negatively towards the other party. The authors discuss a recent development, "negative partisanship," which describes when voters have more hostility to the opposite party than they do affinity to their own.

This describes me. I have a deep disdain for the Republican Party for all of the obvious reasons right now. But I also don't particularly care for the Democratic Party. I vote for them out of necessity in a two-party system, but I think their clinging onto the establishment (and some policy choices, but whatever) harms both them and the country.
