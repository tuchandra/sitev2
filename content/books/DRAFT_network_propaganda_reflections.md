Many of my thoughts on *Network Propaganda*; very much a work in progress.

On post-truth: there's a really great quote about the goal of disinformation being to convince people that we live in a post-truth world, and that there's nothing you can do to know what is or isn't true. I notice this in myself---questioning things a lot more, wondering if *anyone* can truly be "unbiased," and then conflating "unbiased" with "factual." No, people can't be unbiased; but yes, mainstream media is still driven by truth-seeking, and there are checks in place to maintain this dynamic.
